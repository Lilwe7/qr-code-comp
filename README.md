### overview

This is a static QR code component project built with just HTML and CSS.

## My process

After thinking about how to go about this project (my first), I decided to create a div within a div. This helped me play around with the inside div to get it centred, as well as edit all the other parts to create the QR code.
I used sans-serif font-family in the body (for the text).
The image was provided by frontendmentor. I used the text given on the text given on the final project.
I used pixels to change height, width, margins, paddings etc.
I would like to get views on how others went about this project.

I have not yet learned how to do the project (or any project) for both desktop and mobile. I use a mac and that is what I used for this project.

The project took me approximately 2-3 hours cumulatively. With much practice, I hope to quickly go through projects quicker.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

Took me a while to figure out why my div was not centering in the beginning, then i realized i was not putting the units in px.

''' i wrote something like - "margin 50 auto 50" instead of "margin 50px auto 50px" '''

All in all, I did a lot of tweaking around the numbers and dimensions to get the QR code looking a little like the assignment.

I would appreciate a quicker and more efficient way of writing the code. Thanks.

### Continued development

I intend to continue honing my new skills in basic HTML and basic CSS by building projects every few days.
I am now going into bootstrap and JS.

PS - I am new to coding (/programming).

### Useful resources

- W3schools; MDN site; devdocs.io etc
